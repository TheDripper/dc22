"a shimmering dark, like the wind at night: she is draped in lavender with brillant birds and snakes on her shoulders and ankles, leaning on a case of grapefruit lacroix.",,,
"theres a vietnamese woman that streams from what looks like a refugee camp. Another is simply in a corner: white walls/floor, and an awkward dangle of cheap christmas lights marking where the walls meet. Sparky43323 is asking her to spin around real fast.",,,
"one starts out looking like the unibomber and it takes her 2-3 hours to finally take off the baseball cap and sweater to reveal her tight, fleeting body.",,,
"at one point I built a website for a startup called DEEP ISOLATION that wanted to store nuclear waste by shooting into abandoned fracking wells, and that's about how I feel here inside my apartment.",,,
As i'm waiting for the interview I look out the window and recognize the building across the freeway from an SFGate article about a hostage situation at the UPS distro center: there was a photo with people holding their hands up on the roof. This is what I'm thinking about as the manager walks in.  ,,,
"he wakes up and can feel every single neurotransmitter navigating the electric chasms of his brain, which might sounds miraculous if things were running smooth except the patterns are slightly off like misfiring pistons and so all he feels is a grinding.",,,
Why the fuck am I trying to edit in this state? What a brilliant waste. I spent today asleep. I spent today looking at coworkers through a wormhole in my face. I woke up after work and went to the bar. I smoked cigarettes in the parking lot with my neighbors and felt thick and rotated. We talked about things. I have been thinking the same thought for 3 days. I woke up and drank desperately in an attempt to change this. ,,,
And it worked: but my throat is raw and gravity has begun to flank me from new sides. My breath is miles away. The sun will come up again and remind me of everything I can't think of now. I'll struggle to remember what I did. Then I'll do it again.,,,
walking around wearing obviously inadequate oxygen intake,,,
"scars physicalize your history like the light line on my right ring finger from when I shattered a coffee mug in my own clenched fist after going to get my bedsheets back from my newly ex girlfriend to find my buddy passed out naked in them, or the swelling in my right eyelid after my neighbors kid speared me in the face with her skull playing four-square. you can see the past on you, it is absorbed into your body and becomes it. ",,,
Webs of sense woven into threads pulling muscle and hang a space which I call myself,,,
mind floats cosmic underwater turning in these pools of vision,,,
drifting these nervous reaches,,,
colors finally letting their heat go rising into the grey that glides behind everything,,,
this mad collision singing into our senses is silent when we demand to hear beyond the song-,,,
"we find ourselves bored in a place that is literally exploding,",,,
we claim to have control over a momentum that's been ripping shockwaves accross galaxies since before the human body even had a face-,,,
"we've accumulated enough bloody beating mass to start echoing the universe back inside our frames, the harmonics of these waves shaking our limbs into life, all the gestures of our finding and fearing and losing and hating and loving and fucking each other,",,,
"steady steps a metronome behind our inhale and the voice that flies back out, letting our heat go rising into the invisible color that hides behind everything.",,,
I am dragged from room to room like a balloon. ,,,
Everyone in the cafe flanked on all sides by papers and wires and screens and looking pissed or lobotomized. Someone has clogged the shitter with paper towels in apparent act of terrorism given that we're all here pounding medium roast. ,,,
"Taste of plaque and tobacco on the freeway. Morning mouth has glued the filter to my lips. Sweating sedatives and stimulants simulatenously, my skin shines electric with elaborate unrest. Webs of sense woven into threads pulling muscle hang a space which I call myself. I claim to have control over a momentum that's been ripping shockwaves across galaxies since before the human body had a face, finally shaking our limbs into all the gestures of our finding and loving and fucking and fearing and losing and hating and loving and fucking each other, doing 90 on 80 and letting my heat and smoke go rising into the invisible color that hides behind everything.",,,
"Still on the same trip even with different chairs and faces in the room, I am thinking again of my dead friend and her unburnt red hair and how much I regret not fucking her when she wanted me to. I think about this at least once a week even after 10 years.",,,
The sun is still up so I don't have to go home yet. There's nowhere for me to be and nobody's looking for me. Go home and peel the skin off my hands and feet next to my cat. Really I'm secretly hoping one of the servers will get bored and offer me drugs for the conversation given how dead it is in here.,,,
"baking in the smell of gas station coffee and radiated automobile heat, rummaging neural imagery for some moment to hope for. ",,,
"Chug more adrenaline into your kidneys and pry your swollen eyes back open with 4k pixels of blue LED for 8 hours before stumbling outside into the hissing sunshine and scrouging behind the overpass to sneak hits of weed vape from your curled fist. Blank in a flourscent coffin and cold like the water cooler, withering away among the network and watching your weight drop with every upload to the server.",,,
"I am getting high in the shade with my sweater on and trying to clear my head of agnoizing visions: Her, dark, in a striped dress next to the LaCroix. I was downwind of her moisturerizer with a face like I'd gone incognito. She was blinking at me and talking about old movies as traffic was visilbly gathering outside the office windows but somehow nobody came into the lunchroom, except the lady who cleans afternoons and she kept bouncing nervous glances off me like I was a school shooter.",,,
I retreat into a former warehouse to drink Hazy IPA and Vida Mezcal while surrounded televisions displaying slow motion footage of 20-something latinas talking about cheesesteak on the soccer channel. Many of the people in here are product managers. Many of their products are on the televisions in slow motion. I am waiting on emails from Github or my mom while the happy hour crowd dwindles to just people with no place to go.,,,
I am staring into the abyss inside my skull while smoke silently fills the room.,,,
motherfuckers want to feel superior because they can be sober and still be okay to go to work,,,
"turning the volume down on my spotify at the bbq, a subtle fuck you uninentional but not unnoticed. ",,,
I can't remember the point at which I decided to keep drinking beers and stop counting so here I am between the chords and the freewyay pounding fingers into zeros and ones feeling like I'm on acid only that yesterday and everybody keeps looking at me like I'm weird but I want to text my downstairs neighbor for just one more cigarette even though we've just about split a pack at this point and I'm wondering what that means.,,,
Every movement he makes seems to be in desperation: he claws out of bed in the morning like it's trying to eat him. He runs to the shitter like it might just start dripping out of him any second. He pushes down the sidewalk like he's dodging sniper fire.,,,
Sometimes he manages to land himself in a productive chain of events until the moment splits apart like an atom bomb of infinite possibilities cascading before him and he disintegrates into a gasping stammering panic: spitting syllables and consonants at single arched eyebrows that just seem to go higher and higher until he sequesters himself in the bathroom with a joint and the sound of the running shower. ,,,
"The first line in his journal his 3D PRINTERS, underlined, and then a note not to take the immunomodulators his gastro gave him. ",,,
"I am getting by on Internet cash working remote posting ad copy for a weed delivery service and has become massively addicted, which actually makes his work more difficult as  adjectives like ""Euphoric"" and ""Creative"" and ""Relaxed"" have lost all meaning for him and have melted into the abstracted normality of dependence he now lives in. In fact he hates weed, but nonetheless must constatnly muster cheerful new puns on wellness and the benefits of highly accurate dosing. ","Two blondes in the OC are on the veranda drinking beer out of Commemerative 2007 Operation Iraqi Freedom glasses whose paint is not dishwasher safe and so is mostly washed away now. It features a coat of arms with the scales of justice alongside paratroopers and some f-22s.
The mother is wearing a shirt that says “I WANT FELICIA’S LIFE ALWAYS GOING SOMEWHERE” which I think is some weird helicopter-y declaration of obsession over her daughter (at right, in stripes, currently indignant), before I realize there’s a period “…LIFE. ALWAYS GOING SOMEWHERE.”, this being a reference to the famous MadTV line “BYE FELICIA”, so the rich white lady is really missing the point here that Felicia is a social outcast due to her hideous behavior- no one would ever want her life, not even her.",,
"Today his work has been hijacked by an intense wave of nostalgia for virtual places. Gitty grand-theft loading docks and floating/sinking castles by the sea that don't actually exist anywhere except in electric temporal suspension between taiwanese graphics boards probably now writhing in a time-lapsed sun bleach at the landfill. But still he can remember these places as if he were acutally there, even though really he was slumped in his brothers oversized t-shirts sitting in the same guest bedroom as bright red sony digits silently signaled the glittery passing of his 90s childhood. ",,,
"Minutes later he is in a shady summer living room with curtains blocking the glare for a very large LCD television screen on the couch next to the first girl in high school to express sexual affection for him, although it never manages to explicitly manifest. it was the early 2000s, so you could get on cable most hours and watch documentary footage of people smoking meth out of aluminum foil in their cars.",,,
This is what they are doing and perhaps the romantically tone deaf subject matter is why she enivitably goes for the water polo player and leaves him dropping out of band to eat cinnamon pita chips out behind the tennis club. Their romance remains an open question until she is hit by a freight train during her senior year at a liberal arts college in the midwest.,,,
doing vulgar calculus with a look on my face like i've gone incognito,,,
put a smiling millennial on the homepage of your website,,,
she asked me to write her hands into it,,,
like how they’re shaky or always kinda cold ,,,
but almost maddeningly smooth,,,
the autistic pleasure of watching the same pieces of media over and over and over again,,,
turns out you’re not the only one who likes to get stoned and zone out to soft spoken ladies talk about blouses on QVC.,,,
hospital curve to the skyway,,,
slow getting past the seam,,,

"it’s the 10th anniversary of the leheman brothers collapse and I am inhaling luxury cannabis vapor product over interstate 880 with kai rysdal, watching reams of 8-1/2"" x 11"" explode down the shoulder like flocks of nervous birds. ",,,
"3 panels of gchat screenshare frowning at me pensively from the corners of my 13"" consciousness but I’m falling in love with avatars on project management software and building fantasies out of stock photography models.",,,
have you ever received a relgious omen from an episode of The X Files?,,,
"hideous clutching at low level highs but at least the insurance of receptor saturation and/or vomiting, probably no overdose this evening, just dry sucking lithium heated plastic under brand name forced air utility and either wandering insight or deep and crushing tragedy as the hours are counted off by the recital of numbers and names on national public radio.",,,
"my friend is dead and now my home hangs heavy like a giant residential cemetery - the whole town feels like a gravestone, the air is slow and gentle and vibrates with the low steady tension of someone about ot start wailing: everywhere I look is some glowing fleeting frame from our past, incidental moments which fell into place on secretly perfect after school afternoons before any of us knew our future was in some lobby sucking ad copy or bad data, asleep at the wheel until one day we're typing one handed suicide notes into iOS and waiting for the pills to hit, ",,,
or else getting hard for soft targets and hiding red bull cans full of TATP in the utility closet. i get by microdosing and listening to house on spotify till i start to cry.,,,
the moon is waxing west over the damp debris piles and chicken coops and wrought iron and cigarette grass. i am unable to do anything except sleep and smoke. i coalesce around open seating and hover like uncertain weather. my ancestors mumble in languages thrown in the trash before I was born.,,,
I rip bacon strips of dead eczema skin off the soles of my feet in the white glow of montiors. I am salty and anxious with the passing of nothing. I am dizzy with the smell of oxygen. I am hungry always for the light which erupts between blinks. ,,,
somewhere there is cardiac motion pushing circles of blind fluid between bones and the morning rises a tide across my eyes.,,,
basking in the permenant nothing of our New Weather: all moisture and temperature related indicators of the season having flatlined into an average of 72 degrees farenheit with 0 humidty and rubberneckers causing a slowdown on the northbound side. ,,,
So instead we take our cues from branding and billboards: which holiday colors are on the fun size twix and what flavor latte is at the starbuzz.,,,
"wearing intricate patterns and ducking behind our communical cloak of plasitc and electrical signals, trying to carve out some home from this lonliness, lungs filling with the vacuum of sadness abstracted and dizzy with caffienated shits, drifting these nervous reaches. All the gestures of our finding and fearing and losing and hating and loving and fucking each other, feeling out slippery rhythms against each other’s bodies and pounding steady steps a metronome for the brilliant colors of our inhale and the voice that flies back out. ",,,
i am desperate for the way seasons carry blurry fragments of former selves in the texture of their air like constellations of neruons and hormones somehow suspended in these smells.,,,
"where an organ is formed, it generates use. there is no persistent data associated with this resource. all psychic phenomena are the outcome of conflict. ",,,
My head is all over the street. ,,,
